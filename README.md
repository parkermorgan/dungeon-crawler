# Overview

This program is a simple 'dungeon crawler' style game built using the Python Arcade framework, inspired by the 'Legend of Zelda' franchise. The game focuses on a player character navigating through multiple locked doors. Doors can only be opened if the player possesses the correct key. Upon progressing through the master door, the player enters a second room containing a crown that, when collected, ends the game. The game displays relevant user information, including the keys currently held. It features looping background music and sound effects for item collection and door openings. Additionally, pop-up messages appear to indicate various in-game actions. The game is controlled using the WASD keys.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency with the Arcade framework and fundamental game design concepts. I aimed to create something personal yet inspired by a beloved franchise. Most of my previous projects were text-based terminal programs, so I wanted to develop a visually engaging game.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my programming environment, with Arcade version 3.3.2. Source control was managed through GitHub Desktop.

The game was developed in Python using the Arcade library.

Sprites were created by me using the Piskel Sprite Editor. Sound effects were provided by Juhani Junkala, and music was supplied by HydroGene.

# Future Work

* Implement animated player movement instead of changing the sprite based solely on direction.
* Add multiple rooms, including to the left and right, and streamline the room creation process.
* Introduce different items with unique abilities and environmental hazards that can be resolved using these items.
